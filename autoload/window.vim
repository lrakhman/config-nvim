" Rotate Windows {{{
" Assuming we have a window layout such as:
"    ----------------------
"    |            |   B   |

"    |            |   C   |
"    ----------------------
" And focus is on A*.
" This will move the window positions from A to B, B to C, and C to A.
" Or the reverse: A to C, C to B, and B to A.
"
" This is better than the default <C-w>r because the windows can be on
" different axis.
"
" This will also keep the same widths.
